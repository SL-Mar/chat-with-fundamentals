# Chat with Fundamentals ‚Äî AI-powered Fundamental Analysis and Stock Research

**Chat with Fundamentals** is an application that generates executive summaries about stocks using fundamental data fetched via EODHD APIs.  
It integrates financial metrics, historical stock prices, recent company news, and AI-written executive summaries into a single orchestrated workflow ‚Äî designed to streamline the fundamental analysis of securities.

Built with **CrewAI**, **LangChain**, **FastAPI**, and **EODHD APIs** market data.

## Project Philosophy

Chat with Fundamentals is not intended to be a SaaS platform.  
It is a **research engine** designed to explore how autonomous agents and AI can automate and enhance financial analysis.  
It is built to be **local-first** and **tailored to user needs** through the refinement and upgrade of AI and quantitative workflows.  
All LLM interactions are logged and saved for reproducibility.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Documentation/CWF_demoi1.png" alt="Demo view" width="400"/>
</p>

**Key principles:**

- **Modularity**: Workflows and agents are designed independently.
- **Reproducibility**: All steps (query, fetch, summarize) are transparent and testable.
- **Minimal Overhead**: Lightweight backend with no complex infrastructure.
- **User Ownership**: Users bring their own API keys (OpenAI, EODHD).

## Deployment

You can run **Chat with Fundamentals** locally on **Linux/macOS** or **Windows**. Setup scripts are included for convenience.

### üîπ Linux/macOS

```bash
bash deploy.sh
```

### üîπ Windows

```bat
deploy.bat
```

These scripts will:

- Create a Python virtual environment  
- Install Python and frontend (Node.js) dependencies  
- Copy `.env.model` to `.env` if it doesn‚Äôt exist  

‚úÖ After setup, open your `.env` file and enter your API keys:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
EODHD_API_KEY=your-eodhd-key
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
```

---

## Launch

Once installed, you can launch the full application stack with a single command.

### üîπ Linux/macOS

```bash
bash launch.sh
```

### üîπ Windows

```bat
launch.bat
```

These launch scripts will:

- Open the project in VS Code  
- Start the frontend (Next.js) at http://localhost:3000  
- Start the backend (FastAPI) at http://localhost:8000  
- Open both interfaces in your default web browser  

üìå **Required File: `AAPL.US.json`**

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not delete or rename `AAPL.US.json` in the project root.  
This file is used as a reference knowledge base for internal agents during summary generation and analysis.  
It must remain present for the system to function correctly, even if you're analyzing other tickers.  
To test with other stocks, you may duplicate this file and modify the contents ‚Äî but keep the original intact.

---
## Typical Use Cases

Chat with Fundamentals enables multiple forms of AI-supported equity research workflows, built around real market data and fundamental analysis.

### üîπ Single-Ticker Research

- **Example Query**: `"Is TSLA a good buy?"`
- **Workflow**:
  - Parses the query and identifies TSLA as the target ticker.
  - Fetches the latest OHLCV data, fundamental metrics, and recent news via EODHD APIs.
  - Generates a concise, LLM-written executive summary.
  - Saves the raw data (quotes, metrics, news) in structured JSON format for further use.
  - Provides access to extended analytics:
    - TradingView-style financial chart.
    - Monte Carlo simulation of future stock paths.
    - Value at Risk (VaR) estimation.
    - Daily returns distribution analysis.
    - Correlation and beta scatter plot versus a benchmark.
    - 3-year cumulative returns comparison with the benchmark.

</p>

---

### üîπ Comparative Research

- **Example Query**: `"Compare TSLA and AMZN"`
- **Workflow**:
  - Parses and recognizes multiple tickers (TSLA, AMZN).
  - Fetches individual fundamentals, OHLCV data, and news for both.
  - Constructs a comparative executive summary focusing on:
    - Relative financial performance.
    - Recent price action comparison.
    - News sentiment comparison.
  - Provides side-by-side analytics for both tickers.

## Built-in Quantitative Analytics

Chat with Fundamentals includes a fully local-first analytics suite, extending beyond LLM summaries:

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Future stock path modeling over user-defined horizons.
- **Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES)**: Quantitative risk estimates.
- **Return Distribution Histograms**: Visualizing daily return variability.
- **Beta and R¬≤ Scatter Plots**: Correlation analysis against benchmarks.
- **3-Year Cumulative Return Comparison**: Ticker vs benchmark over multiple years.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Documentation/CWF_demo3.png" alt="Quant Analysis Example" width="400"/>
</p>


Planned future enhancements include:

- Rolling Sharpe ratios and volatility bands.
- Calendar heatmaps of returns.
- Autocorrelation (ACF/PACF) plots.
- Volatility cones and regime-change indicators.
- Drawdown and underwater curve visualizations.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
EODHD_API_KEY=your-eodhd-key

```

(or integrate all routers into a main FastAPI app)

### 4. Run the analysis programmatically

```python
from backend.workflows.analyze import FundamentalFlow

flow = FundamentalFlow()
result = flow.invoke(inputs={"user_query": "Analyze AAPL and TSLA fundamentals and forecast returns"})
print(result.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```
